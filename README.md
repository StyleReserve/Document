## Abstract
Styler is a very familiar appliance to modern people. You can put a smelly coat or jacket in your office after lunch. However, if the styler is already being used by other employees unexpectedly, it will be very difficult. Also, modern people have a lot of clothes and spend a lot of time thinking about what to wear tomorrow. There are even cases where my family wears the clothes that I will wear tomorrow first.
Our team aimed at LG's styler so that we could reserve clothes for the styler in advance, and help people decide what to wear later. Our application not only provides users with the ability to schedule when to use the styler, but also allows them to join my clothes during times when others are using it. Therefore, it helps the stylist not to waste maximum clothing capacity and helps maintain a lifestyle. And it maximizes user convenience by preventing other family members from wearing your clothes first.
